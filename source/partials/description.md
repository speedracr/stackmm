#### Preparation and prework
Once you sign up for the course, we will provide you with a small set of exercises to complete in order to prepare for the course, focusing on HTML/CSS fundamentals and your first steps using git and GitHub to code and upload a basic blog template. If you can dedicate about an hour a day, you should be able to complete everything within two weeks.  

While we provide all necessary software, resources and materials, we ask you to bring a Mac or Linux-based laptop to the course, as we have found Windows to be too much of an X-factor for Rails development. If this may be an issue for you, please let us know and we will find a solution.

#### Location
So far, we have run our courses out of [Betahaus](http://betahaus.com/berlin), one of Berlin’s best-known co-working spaces. Since we are growing for this edition, we are currently looking into getting a space that is equally central in the Kreuzberg or Mitte districts of Berlin, easily accessible via public transport and ideally close to Betahaus.

**Public transport**  
The website of the [Berlin subway BVG](http://www.bvg.de/en/) has more information on tickets, lines and time tables in English. Please note that unfortunately, you are not eligible for a BVG student or concession ticket.


#### Schedule
Web Application Development is a 12-week full-time course running from Monday to Friday. Our Spring 2015 program starts on Monday, April 27 and concludes on Friday, July 17 2015. The last week or parts of it can optionally be completed remotely and we are happy to support you over Skype/ Google Hangout / email / ... as you continue working on your project.

*Daily structure*  
The core time is 9am to ca. 5-6pm, Monday to Friday. You are welcome to stay longer to complete your work or prepare for upcoming lessons if you want.

Every day, we will include mandatory interactive lessons of 2 – 2.5h to advance the course and provide you with new material and skills to apply.
