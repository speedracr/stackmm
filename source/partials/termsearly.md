By registering, I agree to the following terms:

**Course scope**  
Stackademy teaches web application development full-time, Monday to Friday.
We provide all required materials, software and services during the course. Please bring a Unix-based laptop (Linux or Mac) to the course - if this may be an issue for you, let us know and we will find a solution.

**Payment**  
When you register, we will send you the invoice for a non-refundable down payment of
EUR 1,000.- (incl. 19% German VAT). Your registration becomes effective once we receive the down payment, at the latest 7 days in advance of the course. The remaining course fee is due as follows:
  
---

##### Payment in full (total EUR 5,950.- incl. VAT)
EUR 1,000.- down payment plus:  
  
EUR 4,950.- incl. 19% German VAT  
within the first week of the course


---

##### Payment plan (total EUR 6,300.- incl. VAT)
EUR 1,000.- down payment plus:  
  
(1) EUR 2,300.- incl. 19% German VAT within the first week of the course  
(2) EUR 1,500.- incl. VAT eight weeks after graduation  
(3) EUR 1,500.- incl. VAT sixteen weeks after graduation  

If you opt for the payment plan, please **email a scan/photo of your ID** and - unless included in the ID - proof of residence for the address you specified during signup (e.g. utility bill, redacted bank statement) to admissions@stackademy.com.

**Cancellation policy**  
Should you decide to discontinue the course, we will refund your tuition for uncompleted full weeks pro rata (e.g., in week 4: weeks 5-12 are uncompleted, resulting in a refund of 8/12 x EUR 5,950 = EUR 3,966.67 incl. tax). At a minimum, however, we charge the amount of the down payment. The schedule for remaining installments on the payment plan resets to the date of cancellation, so that a first installment of max. EUR 1,500 is due within eight weeks of cancellation and the remainder within sixteen weeks of cancellation.  

We must reserve the right to end your contract with us at our discretion with a notice of 7 (seven) calendar days. In this case, we will refund your paid course fee in full, including the down payment, but will not reimburse any costs that are indirectly or directly associated with the course participation on your part.


**Organizational**  
Stackademy is run and operated by Jonas Knipper (organizer), registered sole proprietorship USt.IdNr. DE282636251. The organizer may choose to incorporate Stackademy as a registered company in the future, in which case the terms of this agreement and the course scope apply as before with the newly established company as the contractual partner.  

The organizer, instructors and students agree to jointly contribute to a positive, constructive and encouraging environment throughout the course.
