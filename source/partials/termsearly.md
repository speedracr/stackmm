By registering, I agree to the following terms:

**Course scope**  
Stackademy teaches web application development full-time, Monday to Friday.
We provide all required materials, software and services during the course and strongly encourage bringing your own laptop and optionally registering for a free Amazon AWS account. Please let us know if either of these may be an issue for you and we will find a solution.

**Payment**  
When you register, we will send you the invoice for a non-refundable down payment of
EUR 1,000.- (incl. 19% German VAT). Your registration becomes effective once we receive the down payment, at the latest 14 days in advance of the course. The remaining course fee is due as follows:

**Cancellation policy**  
Should you decide to discontinue the course, we will refund your tuition for uncompleted full weeks pro rata (e.g., in week 4: weeks 5-12 are uncompleted, resulting in a refund of 8/12 x EUR 5,950 = EUR 3,966.67 incl. tax). At a minimum, however, we charge the amount of the down payment. The payment plan schedule adjusts accordingly.


**Recruiting program**  
Stackademy offers optional participation in its recruiting program to those students interested in taking on employment with a Stackademy partner company after the course as follows:  
Students that receive and accept an employment offer from a company that has an active contract with Stackademy within six months of completing the course will receive a tuition refund of EUR 1,000.- (incl. 19% German VAT), contingent on completion of the trial period as per the employment contract (usually three months).

**Organizational**  
Stackademy is run and operated by Jonas Knipper (organizer), registered sole proprietorship USt.IdNr. DE282636251. The organizer may choose to incorporate Stackademy as a registered company in the future, in which case the terms of this agreement and the course scope apply as before.  

The organizer, instructors and students agree to jointly contribute to a positive, constructive and encouraging environment throughout the course.
